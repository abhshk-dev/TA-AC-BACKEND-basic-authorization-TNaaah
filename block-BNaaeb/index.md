Design a  podcast application where we have 2 interfaces

- admin interface
- user interface

An admin can list podcasts in 3 different sections

1. Free -> everyone can access it
2. VIP -> only for VIP members
3. PREMIUM -> only for premium members

- an admin can edit/delete the podcasts.

An user can logIn as a

1. Free
2. VIP member
3. PREMIUM member

- a free member can view free podcasts
- a VIP member can view free + VIP podcasts.
- a PREMIUM member can view everything.

- a user can also upload podcasts, but first it must be verified by the admin.
- all the user podcasts will always be listed for free members.
